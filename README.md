- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @qwertimer or you can call me Tim.
I am a mechatronics engineer with an interest in Python, Deep Learning, Embedded Systems, Linux and Microcontrollers. If you want to follow my learnings and research check out my zet repository which is a collection of musings on things that i have found out. I also have a repository called learninglabs which is broken into multiple different folders each related to a programming language. You can checkout some of the things i have learnt there. I am currently learning Bash, Javascript and Go. I also maintain a large list of linux scripts that are used in my daily working or were built to satisfy my curiosity, some of these are in stages of development but most are in working order. These can be found in my dotfiles under scripts.
