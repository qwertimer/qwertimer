- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @qwertimer
I am a mechatronics engineer with an interest in Deep Learning, Embedded Systems, Linux, Python and Microcontrollers. If you want to follow my learnings and research check out my zet repository which is a collection of musings on learnings that i have undertaken. I often find youtubers or twitch streamers that have excellent tutorials in Python, Docker, Ansible etc and learn from these and am building up a repertoire of code skills across all areas of programming. I am currently learning Bash, Javascript and Go. If you want to see my learninglabs for some of the things i have played around with. 

I also maintain a large list of linux scripts that are used in my daily working or were built to satisfy my curriosity. These can be found in my dotfiles under scripts.
