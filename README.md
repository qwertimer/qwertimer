- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @qwertimer
I am a mechatronics engineer with an interest in Deep Learning, Embedded Systems, Linux, Python and Microcontrollers. I have recently been following a philosophy of Autodiadact which essentially means that i am constantly learning through teaching myself. I often find youtubers or twitch streamers that i will learn from and am building up a repertoire of code skills across all areas of programming. I am currently learning Bash, Perl and Go. Along with expanding my understanding of Linux, Docker and embedded systems.
