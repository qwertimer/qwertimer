- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @qwertimer
I am a mechatronics engineer with an interest in Deep Learning, Embedded Systems, Linux, Python and Microcontrollers. I have recently been following a philosophy of Autodiadact which essentially means that i am constantly learning through teaching myself. I often find youtubers or twitch streamers that i will learn from and am building up a repertoire of code skills across all areas of programming. I am currently learning Bash, Perl and Go. Along with expanding my understanding of Linux, Docker and embedded systems. 

- Following a twitch technology streamer Rob Mulheistein. I have incorporated his Zettelkasten style of learning into my research where i run a script developed by rob and modified to my needs in which i open a vi buffer and am able to write a small post on what ever i have been researching. This is written in markdown. Once saved the file is then added to github and stored in a zet repo. I have also begun using this design for my own report writing and logging. More can be found about Zets online along with a good overview from Rob on his youtube.

- If you want to learn more about what i do i have started a blog post to lay out my research. Some of the posts will mirror my zets, others will be extensions of the zet. Many of the blog posts are a way for me to store the information that i have learnt for future me to use. My blog can be found at https://qwertimer.github.io/.
